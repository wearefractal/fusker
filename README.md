[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wearefractal/fusker.png)](http://travis-ci.org/wearefractal/fusker)
**Fusker is an application firewall that prevents and manages a multitude of attacks in nodejs**

![How it works](http://i.imgur.com/wkJdu.png)

## Installation

To install fusker, use [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm):

    $ npm install fusker

## Example

Please see [the examples folder](http://github.com/wearefractal/fusker/blob/master/examples/) to get an idea of how to use Fusker properly

## Test Site

You think you're one raw dog? [fusker.nodester.com](http://fusker.nodester.com/) Come at me bro.

## HTTP Configuration
### List of included HTTP detection modules (detectives)
```
csrf - Detects cross-site request forgery in incoming http requests
xss - Detects common XSS attacks in incoming http requests
sqli - Detects SQLi attempts in incoming http requests
lfi - Detects common LFI attacks in incoming http requests
404 - Punishes people who like to snoop around. Only use with single page applications
```

### List of included HTTP payload modules
```
blacklist - Blacklists IP from HTTP server for specified amount of time (banLength in config)
fake-report - Alerts attacker that they have been reported to ic3 and displays DOJ logo
saxroll - Redirects attacker to 1227.com
nimp - Redirects attacker to fusker.on.nimp.org (WARNING: Harmful to attacker)
nyan - Redirects attacker to nyan.cat
goatse - Redirects attacker to goatse.bz (WARNING: Harmful to eyes)
bush - Redirects attacker to full screen George W. Bush "you just fell for the trap"
lemonparty - Redirects attacker to lemonparty.org (WARNING: Harmful to eyes)
meatspin - Redirects attacker to meatspin.com (WARNING: Harmful to eyes)
explosive-impact - Redirects attacker to fullscreen video of ranting
raggedyann - Redirects attacker to extreme speaker rape. (WARNING: Harmful to speakers)
crews - Displays Terry Crews nipple dance rainbow b& page
```

## Socket.io Configuration
### List of included SocketIO detection modules (detectives)
```
xss - Detects common XSS attacks in incoming socket messages
sqli - Detects SQLi attempts in incoming socket messages
lfi - Detects common LFI attacks in incoming socket messages
```

### List of included SocketIO payload modules
```
blacklist - Blacklists IP from SocketIO server for specified amount of time (banLength in config)
```

## Other Configuration
### Express Middleware
Please see [this](http://github.com/wearefractal/fusker/blob/master/examples/express-test.coffee) for a working express example.
It's as easy as ```app.use(fusker.express.check);```
Detectives/payloads are the same as they would be for the fusker HTTP server. Make sure fusker is the first piece of middleware added.

### PROTIP BRO
Setting config.silent to true will turn off all logging
Setting config.verbose to true will turn on a ton of logging
